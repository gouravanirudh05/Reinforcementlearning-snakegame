## Problem Statement:
To train a system agent to learn and eventually(after a lot of training) be as good if not better than us at the classic Snake game.

## Goal:
Our aim was to successfully use the concepts of Deep Q-learning and train a system agent to play a version of the Snake game implemented by us.

## Tech Stack:
* Python
    * Pytorch
    * Pygame
    * Matplotlib
    * Ipython 
    * Random
    * Numpy
    * Collections
    * enum

## How to Run:
* Make sure all the files in the repository are downloaded into the same folder.
* Make sure all the necessary modules are already installed onto the system.
* Run the "agent.py" file as it controls the game and it imports the necessary other files and functions.
* Two windows will pop up, one showing the game and other a graph of current score and also a rolling average.
* Let the model learn for a while, upto about 150 games and be amazed by the results.

## Applications:
Our idea can further be extended to train the system agent to control other games by just changing the game state parameters, the reward function and the complexity of the neural network, we went with a simpler game as this was our first hackathon and we wanted to implement everything from scratch. 

## Further Improvements:
* We could have had a better UI for the game or even chosen a more complicated game.
* We could have added other elements like bonus points or score multipliers etc. to make the game more fun.
* We could have implemented the model such that it was more accurate by either adding more layers to the neural network or even optimising the reward function, we could have also exploited the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation to try more random things at the start. 

## Conclusion
* We would like to end by saying that even though our idea does not seem as complicated as some others, we built everything including the game from the ground up as compared to others who have just used a bunch of pre-trianed models and combined them, also we feel that our project is more aligned with the track 'ML' than some others who have just built a great UI for their models.
